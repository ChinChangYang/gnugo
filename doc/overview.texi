@section Definitions
@cindex worm
@cindex dragon
@cindex cavity
@cindex string
@cindex superstring

A @dfn{worm} is a maximal set of vertices on the board which are connected
along the horizontal and vertical lines, and are of the same color,
which can be @code{BLACK}, @code{WHITE} or @code{EMPTY}. The term 
@code{EMPTY} applied to a worm means that the worm consists of empty
(unoccupied) vertices. It does @strong{not} mean that that the worm is the
empty set. A @dfn{string} is a nonempty worm. An empty worm is called a
@dfn{cavity}.  If a subset of vertices is contained in a worm, there is a unique
worm containing it; this is its @dfn{worm closure}. (@pxref{Worms}.)

A @dfn{dragon} is a union of strings of the same color which will be treated
as a unit. If two strings are in the same dragon, it is the computer's
working hypothesis that they will live or die together and are
effectively connected. (@pxref{Dragons}.)

A @dfn{superstring} is a less commonly used unit which is the union
of several strings but generally smaller than a dragon. The superstring
code is in @file{engine/utils.c}. The definition of a superstring is
slightly different if the code is called from @file{owl.c} or from
@file{reading.c}.

@node Move Generation Basics, Examining the Position, Definitions, Overview
@comment node-name,       next,          previous,     up
@section Move Generation Basics
@cindex move generation

The engine of GNU Go takes a positions and a color to move and
generates the (supposedly) optimal move.  This is done by the function
@code{genmove()} in @file{engine/genmove.c}.
@findex genmove

The move generation is done in three passes:

@enumerate
@item information gathering
@item different modules propose moves
@item The values of the moves are weighted together and the best move is selected
@end enumerate

@subsection Information gathering
@findex examine_position
@cindex information gathering

The information gathering is done by a function @code{examine_position()},
which will be discussed in greater detail in the next section.
Such information could be life and death of the groups, information
about moyos, connection of groups and so on. Information gathering is
performed by @code{examine_position}, which in turn calls:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{make_worms()}
@findex make_worms
@quotation
Collect information about all connected sets of stones
(strings) and cavities.  This information is stored in
the @code{worm[][]} array. (@pxref{Worms})
@end quotation
@item @code{compute_initial_influence()}
@findex compute_initial_influence
@quotation
Decides which areas of the board are influenced by which
player. This function is run a second time later at
the end of @code{make_dragons()}, since GNU Go's opinion
about the safety of groups may change, and it is
important to have the influence function as accurate as
possible. @pxref{Influence}
@end quotation
@item @code{make_dragons()}	
@findex make_dragons
@quotation
Collect information about connected strings, which are
called dragons.  Important information here is number
of eyes, life status, and connectedness between
string. (@pxref{Dragons}.)
@end quotation
@end itemize

@subsection Move generation in GNU Go 3.0
@cindex move generation
@cindex move generators
@cindex move reasons

Once we have found out all about the position it is time to generate
the best move. Moves are proposed by a number of different modules
called @dfn{move generators}. The move generators themselves
do not set the values of the moves, but enumerate justifications for
them, called @dfn{move reasons}. The valuation of the moves comes
last, after all moves and their reasons have been generated.

The move generators in version 3.0 are:

@itemize @bullet

@item @code{fuseki()}
@findex fuseki
@quotation
Generate a move in the early fuseki.
@end quotation

@item @code{semeai()}
@findex semeai
@quotation
Find out if two dead groups of opposite colors are
next to each other and, if so, try to kill the other
group. This module will eventually be rewritten along
the lines of the owl code.
@end quotation

@item @code{shapes()}
@findex shapes
@quotation
Find patterns from @file{patterns/patterns.db} in
the current position.  Each pattern is matched in each
of the 8 possible orientations obtainable by rotation and
reflection. If the pattern matches, a so called "constraint"
may be tested which makes use of reading to determine if the
pattern should be used in the current situation.  Such
constraints can make demands on number of liberties of
strings, life and death status, and reading out ladders,
etc. The patterns may call helper functions, which may
be hand coded (in @file{patterns/helpers.c}) or 
autogenerated.

The patterns can be of a number of different classes
with different goals.  There are e.g. patterns which
try to attack or defend groups, patterns which try to
connect or cut groups, and patterns which simply try
to make good shape. In addition to the large pattern
database called by @code{shapes()}, pattern matching
is used by other modules for different tasks throughout
the program. @xref{Patterns}, for a complete documentation 
of patterns.
@end quotation

@item @code{atari_atari()}
@findex atari_atari
@quotation
See if there are any combination threats and either propose them or
defend against them.
@end quotation

@item @code{owl_reasons()}
@findex owl_reasons
@quotation
The Owl Code (@pxref{The Owl Code}) which has been run during
@code{examine_position}), before @code{owl_reasons()} executes, has decided
whether different groups can be attacked. The module @code{review_owl_reasons}
reviews the statuses of every dragon and assigns move reasons for attack and
defense. Unlike the other move generation modules, this one is called from
@code{examine_position()}.  
@end quotation

@item @code{endgame_shapes()}
@findex endgame_shapes
@quotation
If no move is found with a value greater than 6.0, this module matches a
set of extra patterns which are designed for the endgame.  The endgame
patterns can be found in @file{patterns/endgame.db}.
@end quotation

@item @code{revise_semeai()}
@findex revise_semeai
@quotation
If no move is found, this module changes the status of opponent groups
involved in a semeai from @code{DEAD} to @code{UNKNOWN}.  After this,
genmove runs @code{shapes} and @code{endgame_shapes} again to see if a
new move turns up.
@end quotation

@item @code{fill_liberty()}
@findex fill_liberty
@quotation
Fill a common liberty. This is only used at the end
of the game. If necessary a backfilling or backcapturing 
move is generated.
@end quotation
@end itemize

@subsection Selecting the Move

After the move generation modules have run, the best ten moves
are selected by the function @code{review_move_reasons}. This
function also does some analysis to try to turn up other moves
which may have been missed. The modules @code{revise_semeai()} and
@code{fill_liberty} are only run if no good move has been
discovered by the other modules.

@node Roadmap, Coding Styles, Sequence of Events, Overview
@comment node-name,     next,            previous,        up
@section Roadmap

The GNU Go engine is contained in two directories, @file{engine/} and
@file{patterns/}. Code related to the user interface, reading and
writing of smart go format files and testing are found in 
the directories @file{interface/}, @file{sgf/}, and
@file{regression/}. Code borrowed from other GNU programs is
contained in @file{utils/}. Documentation is in @file{doc/}.

In this document we will describe some of the individual files comprising
the engine code in @file{engine/} and @file{patterns/}. In @file{interface/} 
we mention two files:

@itemize
@item @file{gmp.c}
@quotation
This is the Go Modem Protocol interface (courtesy of 
William Shubert and others). This takes care of all the 
details of exchanging setup and moves with Cgoban, or any 
other driving program recognizing the Go Modem Protocol.
@end quotation
@item @file{main.c}
@quotation
This contains @code{main()}. The @file{gnugo} target is
thus built in the @file{interface/} directory.
@end quotation
@end itemize

@subsection Files in @file{engine/}

In @file{engine/} there are the following files:

@itemize @bullet
@item @file{aftermath.c}
@quotation
Contains algorithms which may be called at the end of the game to generate
moves that will generate moves to settle the position, if necessary playing
out a position to determine exactly the status of every group on the board,
which GNU Go can get wrong, particularly if there is a seki. This module is
the basis for the most accurate scoring algorithm available in GNU Go.
@end quotation
@item @file{board.c}
@quotation
@findex trymove
@findex popgo
@findex is_legal
This file contains code for the maintenance of the board.  For example
it contains the important function @code{trymove()} which tries a move
on the board, and @code{popgo()} which removes it by popping the move
stack. At the same time vital information such as the number of
liberties for each string and their location is updated incrementally. 
@end quotation
@item @file{clock.c}
@quotation
Clock code, including code allowing GNU Go to automatically
adjust its level in order to avoid losing on time in tournaments.
@end quotation
@item @file{dragon.c}
@quotation
This contains @code{make_dragons()}. This function is executed before
the move-generating modules @code{shapes()} @code{semeai()} and the
other move generators but after @code{make_worms}. It tries to connect
worms into dragons and collect important information about them, such as
how many liberties each has, whether (in GNU Go's opinion) the dragon
can be captured, if it lives, etc.
@end quotation
@item @file{fuseki.c}
@quotation
Generates fuseki (opening) moves from a database.
@end quotation
@item @file{filllib.c}
@quotation 
Code to force filling of dame (backfilling if necessary)
at the end of the game.
@end quotation
@item @file{genmove.c}
@quotation
This file contains @code{genmove()} and its supporting
routines, particularly @code{examine_position()}. 
@end quotation
@item @file{globals.c}
@quotation
This contains the principal global variables used by GNU Go.
@end quotation
@item @file{gnugo.h}
@quotation
This file contains declarations forming the public interface to
the engine.
@end quotation
@item @file{hash.c} and @file{cache.c}
@quotation
Hashing code implementing Zobrist hashing. (@pxref{Hashing}) The code in
@file{hash.c} provides a way to hash board positions into compact descriptions
which can be efficiently compared. The code in @file{cache.c} implements a
kind of database for storing reading results, so they can be quickly
retrieved. The caching code uses the board hashes as keys to the database.
They are split since these functionalities are sufficiently demarked that
either file could be reimplemented without affecting the other one.  Note also
that @code{matchpat()} uses the hashing code without also using the caching
code.
@end quotation
@item @file{hash.h} and @file{cache.h}
@quotation
Header files for @code{hash.c} and @code{cache.c}.
@end quotation
@item @file{influence.c} and @file{influence.h}.
@quotation
This code determines which regions of the board are under the
influence of either player.
(@pxref{Influence})
@end quotation
@item @file{liberty.h}
@quotation
Header file for the engine. The name ``liberty'' connotes
freedom (@pxref{Copying}).
@end quotation
@item @file{life.c}
@quotation
The code in this file contains an alternative approach to
life and death based on reading instead of the static approach
in @file{optics.c}. This code is experimental. It is reasonably
accurate but too slow. It is activated when gnugo is invoked
with the @option{--life} option.
@end quotation
@item @file{matchpat.c}
@quotation
This file contains the pattern matcher @code{matchpat()}, which looks for
patterns at a particular board location. The actual patterns are in
the @file{patterns/} directory. The function @code{matchpat()} is
called by every module which does pattern matching, notably @code{shapes}.
@end quotation
@item @file{move_reasons.c}
@quotation
This file contains the code which assigns values to every move
after all the move reasons are gen
@end quotation
@item @file{optics.c}
@quotation 
This file contains the code to recognize eye shapes,
documented in @xref{Eyes}.
@end quotation
@item @file{owl.c}
@quotation
This file does life and death reading. The paradigm is that moves
are played by both players trying to expand and shrink the eyespace
until a static configuration is reached where it can be analyzed
by the code in @file{optics.c} or @file{life.c}.
@end quotation
@item @file{printutils.c}
@quotation
Print utilities
@end quotation
@item @file{reading.c}
@quotation 
This file contains code to determine whether any given
string can be attacked or defended. @xref{Tactical Reading},
for details.
@end quotation
@item @file{score.c}
@quotation
Implements the Bouzy algorithms (@pxref{Moyo}) and contains
code for scoring the game.
@end quotation
@item @file{semeai.c}
@quotation 
This file contains @code{semeai()}, the module which tries to
win capturing races. This module does not work particularly
well and will eventually be replaced.
@end quotation
@item @file{shapes.c}
@quotation 
This file contains @code{shapes()}, the module called by @code{genmove()}
which tries to find moves which match a pattern (@pxref{Patterns}).
@end quotation
@item @file{showbord.c}
@quotation 
This file contains @code{showboard()}, which draws an ASCII
representation of the board, depicting dragons (stones 
with same letter) and status (color). This was the 
primary interface in GNU Go 1.2, but is now a debugging 
aid.
@end quotation
@item @file{worm.c}
@quotation 
This file contains @code{make_worms()}, code which is run at the
beginning of each move cycle, before the code in @file{dragon.c}, to
determine the attributes of every string. These attributes are things
like liberties, wether the string can be captured (and how), etc
@end quotation
@item @file{utils.c}
@quotation
An assortment of utilities, described in greater detail below.
@end quotation
@end itemize

@subsection Files in @file{patterns/}

The directory @file{patterns/} contains files related to pattern matching.
Currently there are several types of patterns. A partial list:

@itemize @bullet
@item move generation patterns in @file{patterns.db} and @file{patterns2.db}
@item move generation patterns in files @file{hoshi.db} etc. which are
automatically build from the files @file{hoshi.sgf} etc. These comprise
our small Joseki library.
@item patterns in @file{owl_attackpats.db}, @file{owl_defendpats.db}
and @file{owl_vital_apats.db}. These generate moves for the owl
code (@pxref{The Owl Code}).
@item Connection patterns in @file{conn.db} (@pxref{Connections Database})
@item Influence patterns in @file{influence.db} and @file{barriers.db}
(@pxref{Influence})
@item eye patterns in @file{eyes.db} (@pxref{Eyes}).
@end itemize

The following list contains, in addition to distributed source files 
some intermediate automatically generated files such as patterns.c.
These are C source files produced by "compiling" various pattern
databases, or in some cases (such as @file{hoshi.db}) themselves 
automatically generated pattern databases produced by "compiling"
joseki files in Smart Go Format.

@section Coding styles and conventions
              
@subsection Coding Conventions

Please follow the coding conventions at:
@url{http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html}

Please preface every function with a brief description
of its usage.

Please help to keep this Texinfo documentation up-to-date.

@subsection Tracing

A function @code{gprintf()} is provided. It is a cut-down
@code{printf}, supporting only @code{%c}, @code{%d},
@code{%s}, and without field widths, etc. It does, however,
add some useful facilities:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{%m}: 
@quotation
Takes two parameters, and displays a formatted board co-ordinate.
@end quotation
@item indentation:
@quotation
Trace messages are automatically indented to reflect
the current stack depth, so it is clear during read-ahead
when it puts a move down or takes one back.
@end quotation
@item "outdent":
@quotation As a workaround, @code{%o} at the beginning of the
format string suppresses the indentation.
@end quotation
@end itemize

A variant @code{mprintf} sends output to stderr. Normally
@code{gprintf()} is wrapped in one of the following:

@code{TRACE(fmt, ...)}: 
@quotation
Print the message if the 'verbose' variable > 0.
(verbose is set by @command{-t} on the command line)
@end quotation

@code{DEBUG(flags, fmt, ...)}: 
@quotation
While @code{TRACE} is intended to afford an overview
of what GNU Go is considering, @code{DEBUG} allows occasional
in depth study of a module, usually needed when something
goes wrong. @code{flags} is one of the @code{DEBUG_*} symbols in
@file{engine/gnugo.h}.  The @code{DEBUG} macro tests to
see if that bit is set in the @code{debug} variable, and prints
the message if it is.  The debug variable is set using the
@command{-d} command-line option.  
@end quotation

The variable @code{verbose} controls the tracing. It
can equal 0 (no trace), 1, 2, 3 or 4 for increasing
levels of tracing. You can set the trace level at
the command line by @option{-t} for @code{verbose=1}, 
@option{-t -t} for @code{verbose=2}, etc. But in
practice if you want more verbose tracing than level
1 it is better to use gdb to reach the point where
you want the tracing; you will often find that the
variable @code{verbose} has been temporarily set to zero
and you can use the gdb command @command{set var verbose=1}
to turn the tracing back on.

@subsection Assertions

Related to tracing are assertions. Developers are strongly encouraged
to pepper their code with assertions to ensure that data structures
are as they expect. For example, the helper functions make assertions
about the contents of the board in the vicinity of the move they
are evaluating.

@code{ASSERT()} is a wrapper around the standard C @code{assert()}
function. In addition to the test, it takes an extra pair of parameters
which are the co-ordinates of a "relevant" board position. If an
assertion fails, the board position is included in the trace output, and
@code{showboard()} and @code{popgo()} are called to unwind and display
the stack.

@subsection FIXME
@cindex FIXME

We have adopted the convention of putting the word FIXME
in comments to denote known bugs, etc.

This will build a file called @file{gnugo-3.0.x/TAGS}. Now to
find any GNU Go function, type @command{M-.} and enter the
command which you wish to find, or just @command{RET} if 
the cursor is at the name of the function sought. 

The first time you do this you will be prompted for the location
of the TAGS table.  Enter the path to @file{gnugo-3.0.x/TAGS}, and
henceforth you will be able to find any function with a minimum
of keystrokes.
