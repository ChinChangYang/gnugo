                       GTP Demonstration Programs

twogtp    : a very useful perl script for playing two gtp processes together.

twogtp-a  : alternative implementation

2ptkgo.pl : Requires perltk and the next program. Plays two gtp processes 
            together with graphical display

ttgo.pm   : required by 2ptkgo.pl

gtp2_6    : patch to GNU Go 2.6 allowing use of the gtp with a
            limited command set sufficient to use twogtp.

vanilla.c : Not useful by itself, this program shows how to spawn a gtp
            process using fork() and exec(). It behaves just like GNU Go
            and could be modified into any number of useful programs such
            as a gtp/gmp mediator.
