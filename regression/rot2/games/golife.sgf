;W[cc]C[golife NR : Golife normally plays rather fast now. Haven't worked on it for a couple of years...
]
;B[gg]
;W[cd]C[golife NR : It also has a lousy interface, so I better not screw up...

;B[ch]C[golife NR : wow...
ingwa 6k*: A daring invasion (11)
golife NR : wow...
ingwa 6k*: And yours also (11)
golife NR : Indeed :-)
NE NR : B7 must be a mistake (11)

;W[dh]
;B[df]C[golife NR : with this speed it will be over in no time.
ingwa 6k*: Perhaps, but computers can complicate things very much (15)
]
;W[ci]C[golife NR : The lookahead is rather shallow as set. How much lookahead does gnugo do?
gunnar 3k : C7 is of course much better than A7. (16)
]
;B[bi]C[golife NR : A8 not much better...
gunnar 3k : A8 looks unreasonable. (17)
]
;W[cg]
;B[bc]C[golife NR : hmm... getting complicated.
]
;W[cb]
;B[bb]C[ingwa 6k*: Lookahead: 16 plys (21)
gunnar 3k : Black is helping white to get stronger. White has H5 for connection now. (21)
golife NR : 16 plys is a lot. Only on a restricted set of moves, I take it.
]
;W[ba]
;B[aa]C[golife NR : It's getting worse and worse.
Micke started observation.
turvoy 5k : neverknow (23)
ingwa 6k*: Yes, only on tactical reading (23)
ingwa 6k*: Capturing and such (23)
ingwa 6k*: No full width search (23)
]
;W[bd]C[NE NR : If W doesn't win this game I will be most surprised (24)
]
;B[bh]C[golife NR : both programs like suspense :-)
gunnar 3k : Many odd moves now. (25)
]
;W[ab]C[NE NR : gnugo doesn't like to capture stones? (26)
]
;B[ca]C[strandhag started observation.
golife NR : what is this? I played several games today, and it did not do such moves then...
gunnar 3k : I'm still waiting for H5 to connect. (27)

;W[da]C[mik started observation.

;B[ac]C[golife NR : I predict an easy win for gnugo at this stage :-)
